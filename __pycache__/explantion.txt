How the Greedy VM Allocation Algorithm Works
Your output shows a perfect example of the VM allocation algorithm in action. Let me break down exactly what happened in this specific case and then explain the general algorithm.
What Happened in Your Example:
Initial state:

Server 1: [VM(4), VM(2)] - Using 6 units, 4 free
Server 2: [VM(8)] - Using 8 units, 2 free

Then you tried to add VM(6), and the final state became:

Server 1: [VM(4), VM(6)] - Using 10 units, 0 free
Server 2: [VM(8), VM(2)] - Using 10 units, 0 free

Here's the step-by-step of what happened:

The algorithm first tried to place VM(6) in an existing server:

Server 1 has 4 free space, which isn't enough for VM(6)
Server 2 has 2 free space, which isn't enough for VM(6)


Since direct placement failed, the algorithm tried VM relocations:

It temporarily removed VM(2) from Server 1
Server 1 now had 6 free space, so VM(6) could fit there
It then needed to place the removed VM(2) somewhere
Server 2 had 2 free space, exactly enough for VM(2)
The relocation was successful, so VM(6) stayed on Server 1 and VM(2) moved to Server 2


This optimal rearrangement allowed both servers to be fully utilized (both at 10/10 capacity).

The General Algorithm:
The algorithm follows these steps:

Direct Placement: Try to place a new VM on an existing server that has enough space.
pythondef try_allocate_to_existing(servers, vm):
    for server in servers:
        if server.allocate_vm(vm, LIMIT_RATIO):
            return True
    return False

VM Relocation: If direct placement fails, try relocating existing VMs:

For each existing VM across all servers:

Temporarily remove the VM from its server
Try to place the new VM in the freed-up space
If successful, try to place the removed VM somewhere else
If both placements succeed, the relocation is complete
If either fails, restore the original VM to its original position




New Server Creation: If no successful placement or relocation is possible:

Create a new server
Place the new VM on the new server



The algorithm is "greedy" because it:

Always tries the simplest solution first (direct placement)
When considering relocations, it takes the first successful relocation it finds without evaluating all possible relocations to find a global optimum
Only creates a new server as a last resort

This type of bin-packing algorithm is especially effective for real-time resource allocation where quick decisions are needed without the computational expense of finding the theoretical optimum solution.



1. vm.py
vm.py defines the fundamental building block of the system - the Virtual Machine (VM) class.
pythonclass VM:
    def __init__(self, memory: int):
        self.memory = memory

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"VM({self.memory})"

    def size(self):
        return self.memory
This class represents a virtual machine with memory requirements:

Initialization: Each VM is created with a specific memory requirement.
__repr__: Provides a string representation of the VM showing its memory size, used for debugging and display purposes.
size(): Returns the memory requirement of the VM, which is crucial for the allocation algorithm to determine where the VM can fit.

The VM class is intentionally kept simple, focusing solely on memory requirements. In a real-world scenario, this class might include additional properties like CPU cores, disk space, network requirements, etc.
2. server.py
server.py defines the Server class, which manages a collection of VMs within a specific capacity constraint:
pythonfrom vm import VM

class Server:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.allocated = []

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Server(Capacity: {self.capacity}, Used: {self.used_memory()}, Free: {self.free_space()}, VMs: {self.allocated})"

    def used_memory(self):
        return sum(vm.size() for vm in self.allocated)

    def free_space(self):
        return self.capacity - self.used_memory()

    def can_allocate(self, vm: VM, limit_ratio: float = 1.0):
        return vm.size() <= self.capacity * limit_ratio - self.used_memory()

    def allocate_vm(self, vm: VM, limit_ratio: float = 1.0):
        if self.can_allocate(vm, limit_ratio):
            self.allocated.append(vm)
            return True
        return False

    def remove_vm(self, vm: VM):
        self.allocated.remove(vm)

    def clear(self):
        self.allocated.clear()

Initialization: Each server is created with a fixed capacity (maximum memory).
__repr__: Provides a detailed string representation showing capacity, used memory, free space, and allocated VMs.
Memory Management:

used_memory(): Calculates total memory used by summing up all VM sizes.
free_space(): Calculates remaining available memory.


VM Operations:

can_allocate(): Determines if a VM can fit on the server based on:

The VM's size
The server's capacity
A limit ratio that can restrict usable capacity (e.g., keeping 10% in reserve)


allocate_vm(): Attempts to add a VM to the server if space permits.
remove_vm(): Removes a specific VM from the server.
clear(): Removes all VMs from the server.



The Server class enforces capacity constraints and provides the necessary operations for the allocation algorithm to manipulate VM placements.
3. allocator.py
allocator.py contains the core allocation logic that determines how VMs are distributed across servers:
pythonfrom server import Server
from vm import VM
from config import LIMIT_RATIO

def try_allocate_to_existing(servers, vm):
    for server in servers:
        if server.allocate_vm(vm, LIMIT_RATIO):
            return True
    return False

def greedy_allocate(servers: list[Server], new_vm: VM):
    if try_allocate_to_existing(servers, new_vm):
        return servers
    
    vm_mappings = []
    for server in servers:
        for vm in server.allocated:
            vm_mappings.append((server, vm))
    
    for server, vm in vm_mappings:
        server.remove_vm(vm)
        
        if try_allocate_to_existing(servers, new_vm):
            if try_allocate_to_existing(servers, vm):
                return servers
            
            for s in servers:
                if new_vm in s.allocated:
                    s.remove_vm(new_vm)
                    break
            
        server.allocate_vm(vm)
    
    new_server = Server(servers[0].capacity)
    new_server.allocate_vm(new_vm, LIMIT_RATIO)
    servers.append(new_server)
    return servers
This file implements a greedy bin-packing algorithm with two key functions:

try_allocate_to_existing():

A helper function that attempts to place a VM on any existing server
Iterates through servers in their original order
Returns True if placement succeeds, False otherwise
This function embodies the "first-fit" approach to greedy allocation


greedy_allocate():

The main allocation algorithm that uses multiple strategies:


Direct Placement (lines 9-10):

First tries to place the new VM directly on an existing server
If successful, returns immediately


VM Relocation (lines 12-27):

Creates a list of all (server, VM) pairs across all servers
For each pair, tries:

Removing the existing VM
Placing the new VM in the freed space
Finding a place for the removed VM


If both placements succeed, returns the new configuration
Otherwise, restores the original configuration and tries the next pair
This effectively tries all possible single-VM relocations


New Server Creation (lines 29-32):

As a last resort, creates a new server with the same capacity
Places the new VM on this server
Adds the new server to the server list





The algorithm employs a multi-level greedy approach - it takes the first successful placement at each level of strategy (direct placement, single relocation, new server) without exploring all possible combinations or optimizing globally.
4. main.py
main.py provides the user interface and orchestrates the system components:
pythonfrom server import Server
from vm import VM
from allocator import greedy_allocate
from config import DEFAULT_SERVER_CAPACITY

def print_servers(servers):
    print("\nCurrent Server States:")
    for i, s in enumerate(servers):
        print(f"S{i + 1}: {s}")

def main():
    servers = [Server(DEFAULT_SERVER_CAPACITY)]

    print("Enter CPU requirements for VMs (type 'exit' to stop):")
    while True:
        entry = input("New VM > ")
        if entry.lower() == 'exit':
            break
        try:
            mem = int(entry)
            vm = VM(mem)
            servers = greedy_allocate(servers, vm)
            print_servers(servers)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
This file ties everything together:

Initialization:

Creates the initial server with the default capacity


Input Loop:

Continuously prompts for VM memory requirements
Creates VM objects
Calls the allocation algorithm
Displays the updated server states


Display Logic:

print_servers() shows the current state of all servers with enumeration
This gives visibility into how the allocation algorithm is working



In summary, main.py serves as the entry point and provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with the VM allocation system.
System as a Whole
Together, these files implement a dynamic VM allocation system that:

Models VMs with memory requirements
Models servers with capacity constraints
Implements a multi-strategy greedy allocation algorithm
Provides an interactive interface for testing and demonstration

The system demonstrates principles of resource allocation, bin-packing algorithms, and object-oriented design in a practical context similar to real-world cloud resource management systems.
